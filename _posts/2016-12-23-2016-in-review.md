It all started at the beginning of 2015, when I was in London at [Animade](http://animade.tv) for a three month internship. I wanted to learn everything front-end development, and after two months of doing so I was quite proficient in HTML and CSS.

In an effort to keep me learning for the last month of my internship, [Simon](https://twitter.com/simonneveu) and [James](https://twitter.com/jameschambers) encouraged me to learn and tiral this new, hot JavaScript framework called React. I dove into tutorials and the documentation, and built a tiny [marketing project](http://frankensim.animade.tv) with React, Flux and Grunt. (massive props to [Milo Targett](https://twitter.com/milotargett) for coming up with the idea and illustrations for it)

After the internship I wanted to keep getting better at React, so I built a [personal side project](http://sharingbuttons.io) with it. As I was building that, I noticed that I was spending the same amount of time doing the exact same things at the start; creating all the necessary folders and scaffolding to get started with actually building my app. After I had done just the setup I thought "I should save this somewhere", copy and pasted that tiny folder structure into a separate folder and pushed it up to GitHub.

Little did I know that this tiny, personal "open source project" (read: repo on GitHub) would go on to have almost 11,000 stars, be used by a ton of companies big and small in important projects, and see hundreds of people from all around the world contribute to it.

But I'm jumping ahead of myself here.

As the second half of 2015 rolls around I try (again) to study Computer Science at the local technical university, but my joy of programming is sadly not accompanied by a joy for converting numbers from the binary to the decimal system and back. (much to the dismay of my parents) I'm still keeping up and writing good grades (acing the one actual programming course, an introduction to Java), but in reality I'm spending most of my time doing front-end development.

It's Christmas (almost exactly a year ago now), and I'm out skiing with my family, our annual holiday. Unbeknownst to me something is about to happen that will change the course of my life forever.

I wake up the morning of the 27th of December, planning to go skiing all day long, and check my messages and notifications. As I open GitHub, I notice the React scaffolding project received a bunch of issues over night. Interesting, that's not happened before! I go to the repo and can't believe what I see.

**Overnight `react-boilerplate` went from 70 stars to 550 stars** and the number of stargazers is still increasing every single time I refresh the page.

I have no idea what is happening. I frantically check Twitter in an effort to find out where all of these stars are coming from, but there's nothing there. I send out a tweet and hope somebody knows:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can somebody tell me what the fuck happened overnight? I wake up to my boilerplate having 500 stars??</p>&mdash; Max Stoiber @ ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ (@mxstbr) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/681004782715301888">December 27, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Thankfully `@___swastik` knows and tells me:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr">@mxstbr</a> â€” HackerNews happened!</p>&mdash; Swastik (@___swastik) <a href="https://twitter.com/___swastik/status/681005846042509312">December 27, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

`react-boilerplate` is on the frontpage of HackerNews, and it's been there for ~12 hours.

<em>From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151227081248/https://news.ycombinator.com/">web.archive.org</a></em>

I had heard of HackerNews, of course, and I had sometimes visited it, but I wasn't active on there by a long shot. Thusly I didn't realise just how massive the HackerNews community is. Literally overnight, `react-boilerplate` gained almost 500 stars, trended on GitHub and was shared all over the place. By the end of this wave, it had something like 2500 stars and a group of active contributors working on it.

## Thinkmill

In February, I somehow convinced Nik Graf to take me with him on a skiing trip to Jackson Hole. After an amazing week jumping down some cliffs ("DO IT JESUS") and carving down some pistes we went to San Francisco, a city I had never been in.

Nik was there on the Stripe Open Source Retreat, working on Belle and DraftJS Plugins. We met at Stripe HQ a bunch of times to hack on open source, and one time Nik told me he had invited Jed Watson, an australian Reacter, to join the hacking session. So we three hung out and chatted, and I remarked how amazing it is what Nik is doing and that I'd love to work on open source full time.

Jed looked at me in a weird way, asked me if I'm serious and, after some more chatting, suggested I join his company, Thinkmill, as their first full time open source employee.

So I flew down to Sydney to meet the whole team and to get a crash course in Keystone, the project I was going to maintain as my day job. I wrote around 1400 unit tests in like three weeks to get comfortable around the codebase.

> I've been working there ever since, though recently I've been spending a lot of time making `styled-components` and not as much time making Keystone.

## Conferences

Around the same time Nik talked me into applying to speak at some conferences around Europe, to share some of the things I had learned while making `react-boilerplate`. I wrote three different CFPs and started sending them out, not really expecting to be accepted anywhere.

I could not have been wronger. I was accepted and spoke at 15 different conferences, spending weeks preparing, practicing and performing talks and sharing my knowledge. I flew all over Europe and even to the US once.

It sounds really glamorous and the pictures sure make it seem that way, but in reality it's so exhausting. Constantly being on the move, always catching the next plane is fun the first few times around, but after a year of flying all the time I'm really sick of it. Next year, I'll only speak at 6-8 conferences, not more. I just want to be home for a while.

### Building CarteBlanche for ReactEurope

A highlight of this whole conference thing was being accepted to talk at ReactEurope in Paris with Nik. We had an idea for a super cool project based on Guillermo Rauch's landmark [PureUI]() essay. It would be a webpack plugin that's simple to integrate, and show you all of your React (and eventually Angular 2, Ember,...) components in a separate space. Developers could visually fuzz test their components, adding and saving variations of them.

We submitted a CFP explaining our really cool idea, and said "If this gets accepted we'll actually sit down and build it". Of course, contrary to what we expected we got accepted and now had to actually build this thing.

As it turns out, building a webpack plugin is not an easy thing to do. We started working on what was going to become CarteBlanche three months before the conference, but didn't really get anywhere. Things started taking off once [Jan](https://twitter.com/jantimon), the maintainer of the HTMLWebpackPlugin, started helping us.

We spent two months before the conference frantically working 60+ hours per week trying to get this done and ready for launch. We went to Paris, and basically the sole thing I remember from the conference is sitting in the back, hacking away to get some last minute polish in. (and some karaoke)

CarteBlanche was a great idea and we can really far in a short amount of time, but it needed another month or two of development before one could consider it "production ready". From all of that stress and exhaustion of working on it I cannot stand looking at that codebase anymore, which is why we stopped working on it.

## Numbers

I love looking at the most random statistics, so here are some numbers from this year:
