title: My Hardware Setup

I am always interested in other peoples tech stacks, both software and hardware wise, so I thought I might as well share mine. (The software one will come soon^(tm))

## What I Have
### Laptop
I use a *13" Late-2013 MacBook Pro* with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5 and 16GB of memory. I am very happy with both the form factor and the machine itself. After using a 15" laptop for two years and dreading having to carry it around everyday, the choice to switch to a 13" device was not a hard one. 

The harder choice was the switch to Mac. Previously, I had religiously used Windows machines, and had even changed from an iPhone to an Android phone a few months prior. My sole experience with OSX was brief tech support for my sister on her iMac. Badly in need of an upgrade, and completely undecided, I stumbled upon a great deal for this MacBook on a local classifieds website â€” and pulled the trigger. 

I am very happy I did.

The build quality of this laptop is better than any I have ever had, it basically feels bomb proof. OSX took a while to get used to, but I cringe every time I see Windows (especially 8) now.
