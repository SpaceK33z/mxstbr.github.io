I have really unproductive days where I don't do anything except watch videos all day long. (my girlfriend can attest to that...) While those days feel great while I'm watching videos, afterwards I always feel horrible for procrastinating and not getting anything done.

After a particularly unproductive week, I noticed a tiny thing that helped me stay on track for an entire day:

**I do not look at my phone first thing in my morning**

It sounds ridiculously simple (it is once you're used to it), but it makes my days so much more productive.

Whenever I manage to avoid Twitter, Facebook, notifications etc. in the morning, somehow I don't feel as pressured to check social networks the entire day. (I do check them, but much less)

Right now, I still have to force myself to start the day by reading a few pages of a book. ([my goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/mxstbr)) It's a struggle every morning, but I'm getting better at it and it makes my entire day much better. My brain feels more focussed an track, whereas when the first thing I do in the morning is check Twitter my brain is all over the place.

I actually bought a cheap, very stupid clock. The only things this clock can do is show the time and ring an alarm at a certain time. Literally nothing else â€“ that way I avoid having to use my phone as an alarm, which makes my look at it first thing in the morning etc.
