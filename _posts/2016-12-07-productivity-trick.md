I have unproductive days sometimes, doing nothing except watching videos all day long. (my girlfriend can attest to that...) After one of those days I always feel horrible for procrastinating and not getting anything done.

After a particularly unproductive week, I noticed a tiny thing:

**Not looking at my phone first thing in my morning makes for a much more productive day**

If that sounds ridiculously simple that's because it is.

When the first thing I do in the morning is check Twitter my brain is all over the place the whole day and I can't stay focussed.

I actually bought a cheap, very stupid alarm clock so I don't have to use my phone as an alarm. The only things this clock can do is show the time and ring an alarm at a certain time; that's it! That way I don't even accidentally check my phone.

Right now, I still have to force myself to start the day by reading a few pages of a book. ([goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/mxstbr)) It's still a struggle every morning, but I'm getting better at it.

What's a tiny lifehack that makes your day better? Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mxstbr)!
